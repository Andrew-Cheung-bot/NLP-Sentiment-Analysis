This is a guide on how to download and use the FastText.

Firstly, download and release the .vec file for German from the following link: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-crawl/cc.de.300.vec.gz

Then, we can load the word embedding model with the following code:

```python
from gensim.models import KeyedVectors

model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('cc.de.300.vec', binary=False)
```

Example of usage:

```python
print(model["hello"])
print(model["Pr√§zision"])
```
